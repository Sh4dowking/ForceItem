# ForceItem - Competitive Minecraft Minigame Plugin

A fast-paced, competitive minigame for Minecraft servers where players race to collect randomly assigned target items within a time limit.

## üéÆ Game Overview

ForceItem challenges players to quickly gather specific items from the survival world. Each player receives a unique target item and must collect it before time runs out. The twist? Players can use "jokers" to skip difficult targets, but strategic use is key to victory!

- **Personal Backpack System**: Each player gets a 27-slot personal storage accessible during games
- **Enhanced Joker Rewards**: Using jokers now gives you the skipped item as a physical reward
- **Admin Skip Command**: Administrators can skip any player's target with `/skip <player>`
- **Smart Target Assignment**: No duplicate targets per player in a single game
- **Immersive Game Start**: Professional 3-2-1 countdown with sound effects
- **Mid-Game Join Support**: Players can join ongoing games seamlessly
- **Individual Boss Bars**: Personal display system for each player

### Special Items
- **Jokers** (Red Barrier): Right-click to skip current target
- **Backpack** (Bundle): Right-click to open 27-slot personal storage
- Both items cannot be dropped and are automatically provided

## üîß Configuration

The plugin works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults. All items are sourced from a carefully curated survival-obtainable whitelist including:

- Basic blocks (stone, dirt, ores)
- Wood types and variants  
- Tools and weapons (including chainmail armor)
- Food items and farming materials
- Decorative blocks
- Redstone components
- Nether materials

*Creative-only and unobtainable items are excluded for fair gameplay. Problem items like grass blocks and tridents have been removed to ensure all targets are reasonably obtainable.*

### Game Rules & World Setup
- World time automatically resets to day (0 ticks) at game start
- Keep Inventory enabled during games to prevent item loss on death
- Immediate respawn enabled for seamless gameplay
- Player health, hunger, and status effects reset at game start
